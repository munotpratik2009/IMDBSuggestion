Wrapper around the IMDB Suggestion API. 

The motivation behind writting this wrapper was the bad folder names present in my movie collection.
There were movie names as 12.Rounds.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-DEViSE.avi and I wanted it to be converted to 12 Rounds. 
I thought of parsing the file names manully but it seems to be a big tasks. 
I came across the API while I was looking up something on IMDB. In the search box, it provided search results based 
on the keys you typed. I did a bit of researched and tried to understand how did it all worked.
Once I got to know its working, it just had to be put under a wrapper and run my collection against the search results.

I have only uploaded the wrapper. I will soon upload another file, that would go through your collection and create folders, update files names etc.
